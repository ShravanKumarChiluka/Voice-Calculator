# Voice Calculator

The Voice Calculator is a hands-free tool that performs calculations using voice commands. It interprets spoken mathematical expressions, including basic arithmetic and advanced functions like trigonometry, and provides audible results. This makes calculations more convenient and accessible, especially for users who prefer voice interaction.

**Features**

**Voice Command Recognition** : Supports voice input for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

**Advanced Functions** : Handles trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) and logarithmic calculations.

**Audible Feedback** : Speaks out the calculated result for user convenience.

**Error Handling** : Informs the user of any errors or unrecognized commands.

**Requirements**

1.Python: 3.x

2.speech_recognition library

3.pyttsx3 library

4.re module (comes with Python)




## Installation

1. Clone the Repository
 
```bash

```
2. Install Required Libraries:
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3


    
## Usage

1. **Run the Voice Calculator**: python voice_calculator.py
2. **Give Commands**:
Speak your mathematical expression clearly (e.g., "What is 5 plus 3 times 2").
The calculator will process your input and audibly provide the result.

3. **Exit**: To exit the calculator, say "exit," "quit," or "stop."
